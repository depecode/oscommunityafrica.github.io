We are a new budding community of open source lovers in Africa and already have members in several countries in and outside Africa. We are growing and would love for you to be a part of the new movement as we help change African developers from being just consumers of technology to creators! We are open to newbies, intermediates experts e.t.c and are also not gender or culture biased. Join Us!  We Need You!.
